# Tauri Calendar Week #
This is my second time around for jumping into Rust. This time, I am teaming it up with Tauri.

My last try at learning Rust was using implementation of an algorithm to solve a maze. Located at (https://github.com/tyc/Aldous-Broder) 

During the course of working through the various obstacles, I wil try to document the changes as I go along.

## Tauri ##
Tauri is an glue layer that allows Rust code for back end and a Web technology on the front end. 

I am using simple html with css to build my front end.

The home of Tauri is at https://tauri.app/.

## Tauri's main.rs ##

The initial framework from Tauri is autogenerated. It has a very initial skeleton of the code.

## using global data ##

This is a great guide on what options are available for using global data in Rust.

## Using a crate ##

crate is Rust's way of doing an equavalent of #include.

An entry is made into Cargo.toml that specifies which crate is to be used. in Cargo.toml, it also specifieds which version it depends on and if any features in the create is enabled.
